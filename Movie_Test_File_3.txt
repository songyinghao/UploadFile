Frontend should be in Angular
Backend should be in Java
We will be looking at the HTML, JS, and CSS
 
We are looking for a simple Web App:
 
1.      The application will allow a user to upload an XML file
a.      The file can have 1-n number of Movie Records
b.      It should include some Movie Metadata (super high level is fine, maybe 5 fields)
c.      Each Movie Record will have an MD5 checksum
2.      Once uploaded the app will draw a simple table that allows a user to see the metadata.
a.      So if the XML file had 17 Movie Records, then the table should have 17 rows
b.      Uploading another XML file will add to the 17 rows. The rows are persisted in a DB.
c.      Each row will have a control that will allow a user to select and upload a file to go with that record
d.      When that file has been uploaded, the server would generate an MD5 and compare it to that row. IF the MD5 matches, link the file name to the row and persist the file name in the DB.
                                                    i.     You can delete the file at this point
                                                   ii.     A user can no longer upload a file to that row
e.      If the MD5 does not match, then indicate somehow that there was not a match and allow a user to try again on that row.
3.      That’s it.
 
Overall, we will be looking at the code, but we will also be looking into the usability of the app. The above are guidelines for requirements, but you can change things here and there if the overall functionality is intact and you make the UX better. We need devs who can think and look to make things better. Good luck
